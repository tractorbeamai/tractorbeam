## Get Started

### Tractorbeam Cloud (Recommended)

The fastest and most reliable way to get started with Tractorbeam is signing up for free to [Tractorbeam Cloud](https://tractorbeam.ai/).

### Self-Hosted

Open source deployments should scale to approximately 100k events per month, after which we recommend migrating to a PostHog Cloud instance. See our [docs for more info and limitations](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/open-source/deployment). Please note that we do not provide customer support for open source deployments.
